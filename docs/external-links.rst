Python packages
===============
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`__ - The venerable plotting package that we all know and love.
* `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/api.html>`__ - Package for working with annotated ND numpy arrays. If you haven't heard of it and you work with NetCDF files, it will change your life.
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`__ - Package that turns spreadsheets and tables into annotated 2D numpy arrays. Invaluable for certain types of data.
* `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org>`__ - A statistical data visualization package. It has some awesome features, but few people in my field use it because it is geared more toward statistical data than geophysical data.

Downloadable colormaps
======================
The following colormap repositories are
imported and registered by ProPlot.

#. `Color Brewer <http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3>`__ - The O.G. perceptually uniform colormap distribution. These are included with the matplotlib distribution.
#. `cmocean <https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/>`__ - Perceptually uniform colormaps designed for oceanography, but suitable for plenty of other applications.
#. `SciVisColor <https://sciviscolor.org/>`__ - Science-focused colormaps created by the viz team at UT Austin. Provides tools for *concatenating* colormaps, suitable for complex datasets with weird distributions.
#. `Fabio Crameri <http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php>`__ - Perceptually uniform colormaps for geosciences. These maps have very unusual and interesting color transitions.
