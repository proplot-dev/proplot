# Hard requirements for notebook examples and documentation build
# NOTE: Keep up-to-date with ci/environment.yml!
# NOTE: Basemap is broken as of matplotlib >=3.3 so for documentation
# use 3.2.1. Probably lots of basemap holdouts for next ~5 years.
# NOTE: PyQt5 is needed by pyplot, RTD server *happens* to already have it
# but creating local environment will fail.
# NOTE: Jinja >= 3.0 and nbsphinx >= 0.8.2 seem to break default ReST roles when
# jupytext notebooks are converted to HTML. Interpreted as italics instead.
