ProPlot
=======

A comprehensive, easy-to-use `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ wrapper for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics. This project is published `on GitHub <https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot>`__.

Please note that due to my day job as a graduate student, `certain feature additions <https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr>`__ will be delayed to the summer of 2020. In the meantime, if you are interested in contributing to ProPlot, please see the :ref:`contribution guide <Contribution guide>`. Any amount of help is welcome!
