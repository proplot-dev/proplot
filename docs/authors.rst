`Luke Davis`_ is the project creator and primary contributor as of 2021. He is
a PhD candidate at Colorado State University's
`Department of Atmospheric Science <https://www.atmos.colostate.edu>`__
who has always been frustrated by repetitive and
cumbersome plotting code. As an undergraduate, he developed a set of
`MATLAB plotting utilities <https://github.com/lukelbd/matfuncs>`__ for personal use.
When he switched to python in graduate school, he replicated most of these utilities in
python, learned more about the language, began to rapidly develop them, and decided to
share them with the rest of the scientific community. Luke is also working on a project
called `climopy <https://github.com/lukelbd/climopy>`__, a companion to
`metpy <https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy>`__ for carrying out data analysis tasks
related to climate science, and has authored a number of
`vim plugins <https://github.com/lukelbd?tab=repositories>`__
as an avid vim user.

`Riley Brady`_ is the next-biggest contributor. He helped Luke set up automatic
testing, deploy this project to PyPi, and make ProPlot easier for new users. He is
also ProPlot's earliest user and helped fix `a lot of the early bugs
<https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed>`__.
