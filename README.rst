A comprehensive, easy-to-use `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ wrapper for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics.

Installation
------------

This package is a work-in-progress. Currently there is no formal release
on PyPi (ETA: January 2020). However, feel free to install directly from Github using:

::

   pip install git+https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot.git

To upgrade to the latest version, run ``pip uninstall proplot``, then re-install.

The dependencies are `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_.  The optional geographic mapping features require `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ and/or `basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`_.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation is `published on readthedocs <https://proplot.readthedocs.io>`__.

Importing
---------
I recommend importing ProPlot with

.. code-block:: python

   import proplot as plot

This differentiates ProPlot from the usual "``plt``" abbreviation used for the ``pyplot`` module.

Overview
--------

Importing ProPlot registers a bunch of new colormaps and color names.
If this is all you want and you don't care about other features, simply
import ProPlot at the top of your script. See the documentation for details.

Most of ProPlot's features derive from the ``subplots`` command, inspired
by the pyplot command of the same name.
This generates a scaffolding of specially subclassed axes, and has a bunch of other useful features.

The next most important utility is the ``format`` method, available on every axes generated by ``subplots``. Use this method to fine-tune your axis properties, titles, labels, limits, and much more.

Here are some highlights of the remaining features:

*  Improvements to and automatic application of the
   `tight layout <https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html>`__ 
   feature. Figure width and height is allowed to vary
   so that subplot aspect ratios remain fixed, which is particularly useful
   for grids of map projections and images. Arbitrary physical units, including
   *metric* units like ``cm`` and ``mm``, can be used for sizing arguments.
*  Axes panels and figure panels, generally used for colorbars and legends
   that refer to multiple subplots at once. New "inset" colorbars.
   Colorbars from lists of lines or colors. Legends with centered
   rows instead of aligned columns.
*  Helpful ``Locator``, ``Formatter``, ``Scale``, ``Proj``, ``Norm``, ``Colormap``,
   and ``Cycle`` constructor functions, integrated with the ``format`` command,
   ``subplots`` command, and plotting commands. More power and less boilerplate code.
*  Automatic axes, colorbar, and legend formatting when
   ``xarray.DataArray``, ``pandas.DataFrame``, or ``pandas.Series`` objects are passed
   to a plotting command, just like their respective ``plot`` methods.
*  Beautiful new colormaps, named "color cycles", and easy-to-remember
   color names. Tools for merging colormaps and making new "perceptually
   uniform" colormaps on-the-fly. Tools for slicing and modifying existing
   colormaps.
*  Global setting customization with a user ``.proplotrc`` file. Save custom
   colormaps, color cycles, and fonts in a user ``.proplot`` folder, and they
   will be loaded every time on startup.
*  Integration with basemap and cartopy. Generate arbitrary
   grids of arbitrary map projections in one go. Switch between the cartopy and
   basemap backends painlessly. Simplified plotting commands.
   Add geographic features and custom meridian and parallel gridlines and
   labels with the ``format`` command.

What about other matplotlib wrappers?
-------------------------------------

There is already a great matplotlib wrapper called `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`__, and `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html>`__ and `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/plotting.html>`__ both offer convenient matplotlib plotting commands. What makes this project different?

While parts of ProPlot were inspired by these projects (in particular, ``rctools.py`` and ``colortools.py`` are modeled after seaborn), the goals are largely different. Seaborn, pandas, and xarray offer tools for generating rigid, simple, nice-looking plots from data stored in special objects (``pandas.DataFrame`` and ``xarray.DataArray``). Similarly, ProPlot uses metadata from these special objects and gives you nice-looking plots out of the box -- but critically, it also permits a *high level of customization*, permits building *complex grids of subplots*, and includes powerful tools for working with *colors* and *geographic datasets*. While seaborn, pandas, and xarray are meant to be used separately from the matplotlib API, ProPlot is built *into the matplotlib API*, thanks to special subclasses of the native matplotlib ``Figure`` and ``Axes`` classes.

In summary, this project is intended to unify the convenience of seaborn, pandas, and xarray plotting with the power and customizability of the underlying matplotlib API.

Why not add to matplotlib directly?
-----------------------------------
Certain parts of ProPlot conflict directly with the matplotlib API. ProPlot enforces a *static* figure layout with the entire subplot grid declared at figure creation time, so that we can implement subplot panels, exert more control on the subplot layout, and replace matplotlib's ``GridSpec`` class with the ``FlexibleGridSpec`` class. By contrast, matplotlib encourages successively adding subplots and panels to existing figures. ProPlot's "smart tight layout" conflicts with matplotlib's `tight layout <https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html>`__ feature by permitting *flexible figure dimensions* to preserve subplot aspect ratios and by permitting *variable subplot spacing* with the ``FlexibleGridSpec`` class.

Other parts of ProPlot would arguably make the matplotlib API redundant if implemented directly. For example, ``Axes.format`` is convenient, but the same tasks can be accomplished with *existing* axes and axis "setter" methods. Also, some of the functionality of ``subplots`` can be replicated with `axes_grid1 <https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/index.html>`__. Following `TOOWTDI <https://wiki.python.org/moin/TOOWTDI>`__ philosophy, ProPlot should probably remain here as a separate project.

Nevertheless, if there are any core matplotlib developers reading this, and you think that some of ProPlot's features should be added to matplotlib, please contact me!

---------
At well over 10,000 lines of code, this package took a huge amount of time to write and an equally huge amount of time to share online -- especially with my day job as a graduate student.
